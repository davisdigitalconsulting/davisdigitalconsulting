									<h2><span style="color: #0673f1;">Which Digital Lead Strategy Should I Use?</span></h2><div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your overall business strategy and budget will determine the most effective digital lead generation strategy for you to use.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we at Davis Digital have found that Facebook and Google paid advertisements are the most effective way to sell ecommerce products as a startup. As that same company grows to scale, SEO is the more effective strategy long term, in conjunction with a stable budget for ad revenue. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have much of a budget or revenue yet, we recommend building an email list and directly running email and ad campaigns to the list with recurring newsletters and promotional marketing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if  your business is profitable, but has minimal digital presence, and you want to start spending money on marketing? We recommend building out a website with landing pages, retarageting past clients (and similar profiles) with ads, and starting on the content building process with SEO. Overall, we have found posting on social media is great for establishing credibility for your business, but is usually a lot slower in getting your first lead digitally.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company has a well established brand, website, is running ads, and has a good social media presence, you are likely already getting digital leads. Managing the leads, citations, reviews, profiles, and keeping up to date with SEO changes and SERP ratings need to be the things you pay most attention to. All ads need to be refined and updated at least weekly with new experimental designs and videos to get the best ROAS (Return on Ad Spend). </span></p><h2><span style="color: #0673f1;">Building an Email List</span></h2><div> </div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three ways to build an email list: get or scrape the emails from the web (cheapest/fastest), exchange relevant content for email addresses (time consuming but effective), and use previous client’s emails for retargeting. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DISCLAIMER: If you want to scrape data, make sure you abide by all Federal and State regulations before attempting to use the data. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scraping data can be done using a number of paid data services or done yourself using a Chrome addon or the Python library BeautifulSoup. The Chrome addon method is most likely the easiest, and you can easily get over 1000 email addresses in a matter of minutes. </span></p><h3 id="b2b"><span style="color: #0673f1;"><b>Building Content or Offers in Exchange for Emails</b></span></h3><div> </div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a website, or use a funnel servicing company like ClickFunnels, it is relatively easy to set up a content exchange program. A content exchange program involves creating a valuable piece of content for an end user like a checklist, guide, printable, infographic, spreadsheet, video series, or tutorial, and only allowing access to that content in exchange for an email address.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how would you go about creating that content? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out our content guide for email marketing here. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have ever seen a popup window on your favorite website offerieng a piece of content, the company providing the offer is collecting your email for retargeting. Popups are one of the most effective ways to create an information exchange and collect emails for your email list. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in a business that content is not really useful to your end consumer, you can alternatively offer a discount on a product or service in the popup.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can create this same content offer and advertise it on social media or through paid ads to get the results faster if you don’t have much traffic to your website. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not have a website or funnel service, it is much more difficult to get emails in this manner, so we recommend having at least a landing page style website with your branding and information. </span></p><h4><span style="color: #0673f1;">What to do with the Email List</span></h4></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send emails of course! </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend building out and planning a newsletter so that customers are concurrently reminded of your products and services. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember to always have a promotion and offer for new valuable content to your customers. If you are not outputting a lot of content, increase the time span between newsletters. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are constantly creating content like blogs, promotions, videos, etc., the newsletter is a great way to make sure your customers are involved and don’t forget about you. New product highlights or industry innovations are also great additions to newsletters. </span></p><div><h2><span style="color: #0673f1;"><b>Getting Traffic through Paid Advertisements</b></span></h2><div> </div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid advertisements refer to paying a company such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Linkedin, etc. to display a keyword or creative such as image, carousel, video, or GIF to a targeted audience. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO refers to enhancing your ranking on one or more search engines to improve organic traffic. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid traffic through paid advertisements offers a quick way to learn if your target market wants your product or service. We suggest starting on Facebook or Google Ads due to ease of use if you have no experience running advertisements. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you need to do if you want to run paid ads is make sure you have a landing page established. Using the same branding as your website, use a graphic design tool to build creatives that are appealing to your target audience. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If using Google Ads, you want to make sure you know your targeted keywords and phrases by doing keyword research in lieu of building creatives. Lastly, you’re going to want to schedule your ads using a predefined budget.</span></p><h2><span style="color: #0673f1;">Getting Traffic Through SEO</span></h2><div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is an inbound traffic technique that brings traffic to your website or landing page by optimizing it for Search Engine Results Pages. For example, if I want to increase traffic to my blog website about basket weaving, I can use SEO to rank in Google search by optimizing for the keywords “basket weaving”, “how to create baskets”, “DIY Baskets” and so on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are at the top of the results pages in Google, you have greater traffic. If you have more traffic, you have the ability to make more sales through your funnel. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO involves understanding the algorithms of search engines, analyzing keywords, and creating content that meets the needs of both users and search engines. Generally speaking, SEO is a constantly evolving field, with new techniques emerging all the time. It takes dedication and hard work to stay up-to-date with best practices to ensure success for your website.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are willing to do this, it can pay off long term. By having an effective SEO plan implemented, a steady flow of traffic will be reaching your site, rather than in segmented bursts with paid ads. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some basic things you can do to for SEO that may increase the visibility of your site:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform an SEO audit to get an idea of where your site stands</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a Google My Business listing and connect it to your site</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a backlinking plan and build citation profiles (Yelp, Apple Maps, Facebook, Bing, etc)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize headers and compress images</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your site is secure and protected by SSL</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create content around rankable keywords</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize your sitemap and have effective internal linking</span></li></ul></div><h3 id="5"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Conclusion</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital lead generation is an essential part of any business’s marketing strategy. Paid ads, SEO, and email marketing funnels are all effective methods for driving leads to your website. Paid ads can be used to target specific audiences and get immediate results, while SEO and email marketing funnels can help build relationships with potential customers over time. With the right combination of these three strategies, businesses can generate leads in a cost-effective way that will help them reach their goals.</span></p></div>								</div>

									<h2 id="1" style="text-align: center;">Make sure your website is responsive</h2><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><p style="text-align: center;">In today&#8217;s world, it&#8217;s more important than ever to make sure your website is responsive and looks good on all devices. With people increasingly using their phones and tablets to browse the web, your site must be designed to look great on smaller screens. Luckily, there are a few easy ways to make sure your site is responsive.</p><p style="text-align: center;">First, check to see if your theme is responsive. If it&#8217;s not, you can switch to a responsive theme or find a plugin that will make your site responsive. Second, use media queries to adjust the CSS for different screen sizes. This will ensure that your site looks its best on all devices.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Finally, test your site on different devices to make sure everything looks and works as it should. By following these simple tips, you can make sure your site is responsive and looks great on all devices.</p><h2 id="2" style="text-align: center;">Use keyword-rich titles and descriptions for your webpages</h2><div> </div><p style="text-align: center;">If you&#8217;re like most people, you probably spend a lot of time carefully crafting the perfect title for your latest blog post or article. But what about the other important elements of your webpages, like the meta description and headers?</p><p style="text-align: center;">Though they may be less visible, these elements are just as important when it comes to optimization. After all, they help to determine how your page will show up in search results. To ensure that your pages are as visible as possible, be sure to use keyword-rich titles and descriptions.</p><p style="text-align: center;">This will help search engines to more easily find and index your content. In addition, including keywords in your titles and descriptions will also help to boost your click-through rate, making it more likely that users will visit your site. So the next time you&#8217;re creating a new webpage, don&#8217;t forget to give some thought to your title and description. A few carefully chosen keywords could make all the difference in how successful your page is.</p><h2 id="3" style="text-align: center;">Optimize your images</h2><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><p style="text-align: center;">As a general rule, it&#8217;s a good idea to optimize your images for search engines. By doing so, you&#8217;ll ensure that your images are properly indexed by search engines and that they appear in relevant search results. There are a few simple steps you can take to optimize your images for search engines.</p><p style="text-align: center;">First, make sure to include keywords in the file names of your images. Second, use descriptive alt text to describe your images.</p><p style="text-align: center;">And finally, ensure that your images are of high quality and have relevant titles and descriptions. By taking these simple steps, you&#8217;ll be on your way to optimizing your images for search engines.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Reference other authoritative websites in your content &#8211; and have them reference you</p><p style="text-align: center;">If you&#8217;re going to reference other authoritative websites in your content, make sure you&#8217;re doing it right. Nothing is more frustrating than reading an article only to find out that the sources don&#8217;t back up the claims being made. When you&#8217;re including references, be sure to:</p><ul style="text-align: center;"><li>Choose sources that are truly authoritative on the topic at hand. If you&#8217;re writing about cars, for example, a website like Edmunds.com would be a good choice. If you&#8217;re writing about fashion, a website like Vogue.com would be a better choice.</li><li>Make sure the sources you choose are relevant to the point you&#8217;re trying to make. A car review from Edmunds.com might be relevant if you&#8217;re writing about the pros and cons of different car models. But if you&#8217;re writing about the history of the automobile, a car review probably isn&#8217;t the best choice.</li><li>Cite your sources properly. When you reference a website, be sure to include the URL and date of access. This will give your readers all the information they need to track down the source and check it for themselves.</li></ul><h2 id="4" style="text-align: center;">Publish new content regularly</h2><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><p style="text-align: center;">It&#8217;s no secret that content is king. In today&#8217;s digital world, businesses need to provide their audiences with fresh, relevant content regularly. But what many companies don&#8217;t realize is that simply publishing new content isn&#8217;t enough.</p><p style="text-align: center;">To attract and engage readers, businesses need to ensure that their content is interesting, informative, and well-written. Luckily, there are a few simple ways to make sure that your content meets these criteria.</p><p style="text-align: center;">First, consider your audience and what they&#8217;re interested in. Then, take the time to plan and edit your content before you hit publish. With a little effort, you can make sure that your company&#8217;s content is always top-notch.</p><h2 id="5" style="text-align: center;">Promote on social media</h2><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><p style="text-align: center;">If you&#8217;re not promoting your website on social media, you&#8217;re missing out on a huge opportunity. Not only do social media platforms provide a great way to connect with potential customers, but they also offer valuable insights into what people are saying about your brand.</p><p style="text-align: center;">In addition, social media platforms can be used to drive traffic to your website and increase your search engine ranking. So if you&#8217;re not already using social media to promote your website, now is the time to start.</p><p style="text-align: center;">And if you need some help getting started, we&#8217;ve got you covered. Check out our blog post on how to promote your website on social media. It&#8217;s packed with tips and tricks that will help you get the most out of social media marketing.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><p style="text-align: center;">These six tips will help you increase your website&#8217;s visibility in search engine results pages and drive more traffic to your site. But remember, SEO is an ongoing process that requires regular attention. Stay up-to-date on the latest trends and make changes to your strategy as needed. And most importantly, never stop creating high-quality content that is relevant to your target audience. Thanks for reading!</p>								</div>
