									<h2 id="1"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a lead magnet?</span></span></h2>
<p>A lead magnet is an incentive that is given to a customer in exchange for something of value to him or her. There are many effective lead magnets used all over the web and in industry, some of which I’m sure you’ve seen before.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the popup that asks for your email address before continuing to read on a blog? Maybe with a locked section? That my friends, is a lead magnet called locked content. By opting-in, you are exchanging your information (maybe a potential spam email account name) for the ability to read the rest of the blog post.</p>
<p>There are a number of lead magnets that don’t include exclusive content too. Some you may recognize are free PDF’s, eBooks, checklists, free samples, and calculators. All of these are free incentives to get you to exchange your email address for some offer that is valuable to you. If you are willing to spend the time typing in your email address or fill out a short form, you are a warm lead for the company that is slowly reeling you in.</p>
<h2 id="2"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you use lead magnets in your business?</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead magnets are much more powerful than you realize. One email may not be enough to get a sale, but one thousand emails gives you a lot of power in a marketplace, especially one that does not have much digital competition. Here are a few things that you can use the data for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid Advertisements on social media</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Target segmentation&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determining metrics on your customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keywords that attract clients for SEO</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending a newsletter for client retention and remarketing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warm lead emails from your sales team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And much more</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how exactly can you implement lead magnets?</span></span></h2>
<p>The first step is to create something of value to your customers or determine an offer that is actually different from others in the marketplace. Start with testing your one lead magnet and its integration into your digital ecosystem. If you have no file-based resources like checklists or eBooks, just offer something simple like a free consultation. It doesn’t need to be brain surgery.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #4175fc;">Lead Magnets Step-by-Step</span></h3>
<p>In an attempt to cover all bases of understanding, we will assume you have a completely new startup with little or no current business and no digital presence. Feel free to skip any of these steps that you have covered.</p>
<p>1) The first thing to do is to create a website or landing page. At the expense of time, you can also create social media accounts and gain a following. The former is recommended if testing a lead magnet.</p>
<p>Either way, you need some sort of way to attract an audience and accept emails or information. We will not be going over how to get a domain, hosting, and design a website in this blog post. We recommend setting up a WordPress website through one of the major hosting companies.</p>
<p>2) Once you have a digital presence, the next step in building your lead generating machine through lead magnets is to determine a way to exchange your offer for information.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is through a web form or popup. If you are using a web form, make sure it’s on a high-quality landing page.</p>
<p>Look into Contact Form 7 for WordPress users or WPforms Lite to make use of forms. For popups, use things like OptinMonster for creating a triggered popup on your site.</p>
<p>3) Make sure you are in compliance with federal, state, and local laws. Your privacy policy needs to be intact and reachable by the customer.</p>
<p>Collecting sensitive information can be risky, so stick to as little data as you need. Preferably just collect a name and email. Have a checkbox to accept communications.</p>
<p>4) Determine the metrics you want. At minimum, determine the cost per lead that you want to achieve. Optimally that is $0, but in reality it totally depends on your market.</p>
<p>Do some research and look to beat the average cost per lead in your industry.</p>
<p>5) Start generating traffic to the form or landing page so that people see your offer. There are many ways to do this, from running paid ads, to SEO optimization, to cold email marketing.</p>
<p>Figure out what works for you and use it exclusively. Typically, SEO is a long term solution to traffic, and cold email is slow to get started on a new server, so we recommend running either Meta Ads or Google Ads to immediately get views.</p>
<p>Keeping your landing page speed optimized with a good looking design is usually sufficient, but to get the attention of scrolling passersby on the internet, you may need to use some open source content or create/buy your own to get people to click on the ads.</p>
<p>6) Check the data and optimize.</p>
<p>If you are getting traffic but no leads, there is something wrong with your landing page or web form.</p>
<p>If you are not getting any traffic even though you’re paying for ads or marketing, you may want to look at the ads themselves.</p>
<p>For Google Ads your keywords probably are too competitive if you’re spending money to no avail.</p>
<p>For Meta Ads, your creatives are the bread and butter. If you are spending too much money, the target and/or the creatives are wrong. If you are getting leads, now you can move to the final step.</p>
<p>7) Once you have a sufficient amount of leads (preferably over 50), now you can start remarketing to these leads that have already seen your brand.</p>
<p>You can set up automations to send newsletters, updates about your company, and more lead magnets to these potential customers.</p>
<p>As long as you continue to provide valuable information, these folks will refrain from opting out. Make sure you remove them from your marketing list if they do choose to opt out, as failing to do so could result in fines or worse.</p>
<p>Keep it transparent and in good faith and you shouldn’t have a problem.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></span></h2>
<p>Hopefully this gives a reasonable overview of setting up and implementing some lead magnets.</p>
<p>Simply stated, the lead magnet is an offer that you can provide to a customer in exchange for data that you can use to remarket, educate, and hopefully drive sales to your business.</p>								</div>

									<h2 id="how"><span style="color: #3366ff;">How do I use paid ads?</span></h2><p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; color: var(--ast-global-color-3);">The first step into using paid ads is to develop an online presence in some way. Effectively, as long as you have a viable product or service, quality way for customers to reach you, metric measurement, and a way to close the leads, paid ads can help you get business or add to current business volume.</span></p><h2 id="1"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Step 1 &#8211; Having a Viable Product or Service</span></h2><p>A good product is one that effectively addresses a specific need or solves a problem for its target audience. It demonstrates quality through its design, functionality, and features.</p><p>Positive customer feedback, reviews, and testimonials are indicators of a good product (which can be gathered via paid ads if you don’t have any). It stands out in the market due to its unique value proposition, setting it apart from competitors.</p><p>You may already know that you have a good product, that’s market tested, with sufficient branding, and that makes paid ads a little bit easier.</p><p>With a viable product or service, it becomes easier to determine the direction of paid advertisements.</p><h2 id="2"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Step 2 &#8211; Funnel Setup and Metrics</span></h2><p>How are you approaching your customer relationship in your business?</p><p>Who is your ideal customer?</p><p>Sometimes a new or existing business owner does not know the answer to these fundamental questions regarding customer base. Thankfully, with paid advertisements, you can get measurable, quantitative data to determine your ideal customer in a created customer relationship pathway that you.</p><p>Choose an advertising goal that is right for you. Do you want to increase traffic to your website or blog? Do you want more leads (usually this is the case)? Or are you raising awareness for a specific cause? This information will allow you to determine campaign objectives in the paid advertising space.</p><p>That being stated, you need a landing page. At least one, but preferable more to split-test against the market. Somewhere a customer feels comfortable, and is in a position to buy.</p><h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">Landing Pages</span></h3><p>Landing pages do not need to be in the form of an entire built-out website, as there are paid services to create hosted landing pages. If you have a website, and other forms of credibility, that is useful but not the most important factor in lead generation through paid ads.</p><p>Landing pages can be implemented to send the customer to a form, auto-appointment scheduler, web page, email, or phone number that you choose to track. In terms of metrics, online forms and appointment schedulers are the easiest to track and don’t require VOIP infrastructure.</p><p>After landing pages, you are going to need a series of what we like to call creatives. These are videos, images, and documents that potential customers see when they see your paid ads.</p><h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">Creatives</span></h3><p>Some paid ad types need only one type of creative, and without knowing the industry or having customer specified data, it is actually impossible to determine what people want to see. Sure you can use basic principles of design, but outside of that, you will not know until you have market tested data from running metric bound advertisements.</p><p>Now that you have a decent landing page and number of creatives, you can start running your paid ads. It is recommended to choose the platform most likely to have customers that buy in your industry. For example, running an ad on TikTok for funeral homes will most likely be a waste of money. Choose a platform for your ads.</p><p>We recommend Google or Meta ads. These are the most broad reaching with the least limitations to data interference like TikToks for funeral homes. Although it is possible to get leads, your target market will be a bit different.</p><h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">Analytics Setups</span></h3><p>Depending on the funnel you are creating, your analytics may be different. For example, Google Analytics is different than Facebook Analytics (Meta Analytics). Refer to the developer documentation on the respective site to understand how each work with implementation.</p><h2 id="3"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Step 3 &#8211; Convert and Optimize</span></h2><p>Once you have run ads for a designated budget or time, review your analytics data and determine a path best suited for your campaign.</p><p>For example, if you are looking to generate leads, make sure you are optimizing your ads for the conversion rate. Generally, if a particular creative is performing well, you should duplicate it into different segmented markets. If a creative is working but no one is getting past the landing page to convert (high clicks and low conversion rate), you may want to test other landing pages or segments. Increasing spend on performing ads is useful in knowing if there will be consistency at scale.</p><p>Most times, you will need to have new creatives working simultaneously with converting ones. The ratio of which is industry dependent, as well as risk dependent. For example, in the roofing industry, the conversion rate can be high if the quality of the funnel is good, and testing new creatives is worthwhile at a ratio of 1:10 or so.</p><p>Usually, the longer you take data on the ads, the more likely you will understand exactly what that ratio should be for your industry or area.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Conclusion</span></h2><p>In an age of ad saturation, standing out demands a strategic approach that navigates the evolving tastes of consumers. By embarking on these three steps — Having a Viable Product, Funnel Setup, and Optimization — you not only create converting paid ads but also forge a connection with your audience, driving conversions that echo long after the click.</p>								</div>

									<h2><span style="color: #0673f1;">Which Digital Lead Strategy Should I Use?</span></h2><div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your overall business strategy and budget will determine the most effective digital lead generation strategy for you to use.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we at Davis Digital have found that Facebook and Google paid advertisements are the most effective way to sell ecommerce products as a startup. As that same company grows to scale, SEO is the more effective strategy long term, in conjunction with a stable budget for ad revenue. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have much of a budget or revenue yet, we recommend building an email list and directly running email and ad campaigns to the list with recurring newsletters and promotional marketing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if  your business is profitable, but has minimal digital presence, and you want to start spending money on marketing? We recommend building out a website with landing pages, retarageting past clients (and similar profiles) with ads, and starting on the content building process with SEO. Overall, we have found posting on social media is great for establishing credibility for your business, but is usually a lot slower in getting your first lead digitally.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company has a well established brand, website, is running ads, and has a good social media presence, you are likely already getting digital leads. Managing the leads, citations, reviews, profiles, and keeping up to date with SEO changes and SERP ratings need to be the things you pay most attention to. All ads need to be refined and updated at least weekly with new experimental designs and videos to get the best ROAS (Return on Ad Spend). </span></p><h2><span style="color: #0673f1;">Building an Email List</span></h2><div> </div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three ways to build an email list: get or scrape the emails from the web (cheapest/fastest), exchange relevant content for email addresses (time consuming but effective), and use previous client’s emails for retargeting. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DISCLAIMER: If you want to scrape data, make sure you abide by all Federal and State regulations before attempting to use the data. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scraping data can be done using a number of paid data services or done yourself using a Chrome addon or the Python library BeautifulSoup. The Chrome addon method is most likely the easiest, and you can easily get over 1000 email addresses in a matter of minutes. </span></p><h3 id="b2b"><span style="color: #0673f1;"><b>Building Content or Offers in Exchange for Emails</b></span></h3><div> </div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a website, or use a funnel servicing company like ClickFunnels, it is relatively easy to set up a content exchange program. A content exchange program involves creating a valuable piece of content for an end user like a checklist, guide, printable, infographic, spreadsheet, video series, or tutorial, and only allowing access to that content in exchange for an email address.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how would you go about creating that content? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out our content guide for email marketing here. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have ever seen a popup window on your favorite website offerieng a piece of content, the company providing the offer is collecting your email for retargeting. Popups are one of the most effective ways to create an information exchange and collect emails for your email list. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in a business that content is not really useful to your end consumer, you can alternatively offer a discount on a product or service in the popup.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can create this same content offer and advertise it on social media or through paid ads to get the results faster if you don’t have much traffic to your website. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not have a website or funnel service, it is much more difficult to get emails in this manner, so we recommend having at least a landing page style website with your branding and information. </span></p><h4><span style="color: #0673f1;">What to do with the Email List</span></h4></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send emails of course! </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend building out and planning a newsletter so that customers are concurrently reminded of your products and services. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember to always have a promotion and offer for new valuable content to your customers. If you are not outputting a lot of content, increase the time span between newsletters. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are constantly creating content like blogs, promotions, videos, etc., the newsletter is a great way to make sure your customers are involved and don’t forget about you. New product highlights or industry innovations are also great additions to newsletters. </span></p><div><h2><span style="color: #0673f1;"><b>Getting Traffic through Paid Advertisements</b></span></h2><div> </div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid advertisements refer to paying a company such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Linkedin, etc. to display a keyword or creative such as image, carousel, video, or GIF to a targeted audience. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO refers to enhancing your ranking on one or more search engines to improve organic traffic. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid traffic through paid advertisements offers a quick way to learn if your target market wants your product or service. We suggest starting on Facebook or Google Ads due to ease of use if you have no experience running advertisements. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you need to do if you want to run paid ads is make sure you have a landing page established. Using the same branding as your website, use a graphic design tool to build creatives that are appealing to your target audience. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If using Google Ads, you want to make sure you know your targeted keywords and phrases by doing keyword research in lieu of building creatives. Lastly, you’re going to want to schedule your ads using a predefined budget.</span></p><h2><span style="color: #0673f1;">Getting Traffic Through SEO</span></h2><div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is an inbound traffic technique that brings traffic to your website or landing page by optimizing it for Search Engine Results Pages. For example, if I want to increase traffic to my blog website about basket weaving, I can use SEO to rank in Google search by optimizing for the keywords “basket weaving”, “how to create baskets”, “DIY Baskets” and so on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are at the top of the results pages in Google, you have greater traffic. If you have more traffic, you have the ability to make more sales through your funnel. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO involves understanding the algorithms of search engines, analyzing keywords, and creating content that meets the needs of both users and search engines. Generally speaking, SEO is a constantly evolving field, with new techniques emerging all the time. It takes dedication and hard work to stay up-to-date with best practices to ensure success for your website.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are willing to do this, it can pay off long term. By having an effective SEO plan implemented, a steady flow of traffic will be reaching your site, rather than in segmented bursts with paid ads. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some basic things you can do to for SEO that may increase the visibility of your site:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform an SEO audit to get an idea of where your site stands</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a Google My Business listing and connect it to your site</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a backlinking plan and build citation profiles (Yelp, Apple Maps, Facebook, Bing, etc)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize headers and compress images</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your site is secure and protected by SSL</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create content around rankable keywords</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize your sitemap and have effective internal linking</span></li></ul></div><h3 id="5"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Conclusion</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital lead generation is an essential part of any business’s marketing strategy. Paid ads, SEO, and email marketing funnels are all effective methods for driving leads to your website. Paid ads can be used to target specific audiences and get immediate results, while SEO and email marketing funnels can help build relationships with potential customers over time. With the right combination of these three strategies, businesses can generate leads in a cost-effective way that will help them reach their goals.</span></p></div>								</div>
