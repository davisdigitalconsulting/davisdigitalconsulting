									<h2 id="background"><span style="color: #4175fc;"><strong>Background</strong></span></h2><p>This client sells high-end specialty home goods that have prices starting at ~$5k+, so this is a lucrative market.</p><p>The website is set up as sort of an e-commerce store, with all types of products listed. Because this is such a high-end market, most people don’t just buy online, they always speak with someone to match them up with the perfect product.</p><p>They came to us for some help in reducing their lead cost, as well as delivering them a higher volume of leads while maintaining lead quality.</p><h2 id="audit"><span style="color: #4175fc;"><strong>The Audit</strong></span></h2><p>Google Ads is sort of a land mine.</p><p>It is by far the most powerful ad platform in the world, but also has grown to be one of the most complex.</p><p>Make no mistakes about it &#8211; Google’s #1 goal is to get as much money from you as possible, seemingly without any incentive for you getting ROI.</p><p>&#8230;But that’s where we come in.</p><p>The first thing we always do is an audit of the account.</p><p>We’re looking for:</p><ol><li>Current data to gain insights from (what’s working, what’s not).</li><li>Mistakes in the account or setup that lead to poor conversions.</li></ol><p>100% of the time, no exaggeration, we find opportunities that can be improved.</p><p>To set the baseline, here’s what the account looked like when it was handed to us, before any work was done:</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2993 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-1.png" alt="" width="628" height="209" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-1.png 628w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-1-200x67.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></p><p>Cost: $2,020</p><p>Conversion Rate: 0.34%</p><p>Conversions: 5</p><p>Cost Per Conversion: $403</p><p>Right off the bat, we notice that the conversion rate is only .34% which is pretty low, and the cost per conversion is high for what’s expected.</p><p>Here are a few things we did right away to get this campaign restarted:</p><h2 id="tracking"><span style="color: #4175fc;"><strong>Proper Tracking</strong></span></h2><p>Tracking and data is the backbone of a properly setup campaign.</p><p>Without it, you can’t find out what campaigns are actually working, so you’ll never be able to make decisions about what to keep, cut, or scale!</p><p>The problem is that unless you’re an expert, it’s easy to set this up incorrectly (or not set it up at all!)</p><p>In this account, we found conversions like “All Page Views” and other settings like “Count Every Conversion” were setup and were leading to a lot of false data over the years.</p><p>For instance with the “Count Every Conversion” setting, if you click an ad once and opt in 3 times, it is counted all 3 leads when in reality we only have one lead. This is OK for purchase conversion campaigns, but not great for lead gen.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2992 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-2.png" alt="" width="628" height="224" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-2.png 628w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-2-200x71.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></p><p>You see? There are landmines like this all over the place.</p><p><span style="color: #4175fc;"><strong>How we fix it:</strong></span></p><p>We setup all new triggers and tags inside of Google Tag Manager which then sent the data back to Google Analytics and Google Ads.</p><p>We use Google Tag Manager in every account we touch so that all data is going to one place and then being properly sorted.</p><p>It is very easy to trace if there are any problems, and we only have to put one tracking code, Google Tag Manager, onto our pages.</p><h2 id="ctr"><span style="color: #4175fc;"><strong>Increasing CTR </strong></span></h2><p>In Google ads, you have “ad groups” which include a set of keywords that your bidding on, and the ad copy that will be displayed when people use those keywords in their searches.</p><p>When users search for a certain keyword, they’re looking for something very specific and want the solution.</p><p>But when a generic ad pops up, it won’t necessarily match exactly what they are looking for, and that can increase your costs since your CTR (click through rate) is too low.</p><p>In this account, we found that a lot of the ad groups were using the same generic ad.</p><p>This is a big opportunity because 1 ad can’t show the differences in each product, highlight benefits, or characteristics of the specific product.</p><p><span style="color: #4175fc;"><strong>How we fixed it:</strong></span></p><p>We created all new ads with headlines &amp; descriptions that included the specific seed keyword in each one.</p><p>This is one of the most important steps to a high converting campaign because of how valuable the user experience is.</p><p>You don’t want someone searching for “oil changes near me&#8221; and an ad for “tire rotations” coming up.</p><p>It is completely irrelevant and won’t generate a lot of traffic.</p><p>Making this change not only increased the ad relevance score but also made the user experience seamless for what they’re searching for.</p><p>From these major optimization steps and our daily management, these are the results we saw by the end of June, 2019.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2991 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-3.png" alt="" width="628" height="209" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-3.png 628w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-3-200x67.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></p><p>Cost: $1,690</p><p>Conversion Rate: 0.42%</p><p>Conversions: 7</p><p>Cost Per Conversion: $241</p><p>Just with these few strategies, you can see that the cost per conversion dropped over 40% since the beginning.</p><p>But we’re not done yet.</p><h2 id="conversions"><span style="color: #4175fc;"><strong>Increasing Conversions</strong></span></h2><p>Running profitable campaigns takes a multi-faceted approach. It’s often not just what is set up in the account, but also what happens after the ad click.</p><p>A common problem that we see is that people often are driving traffic to their website, but that website isn’t as optimized as it can be for the conversion they want.</p><p>When you have a lead gen campaign going to your normal website, it’s often crowded by all sorts of distractions like navigation menus, content, and it’s not clear what you want them to do.</p><p>You see, when a visitor lands on a page, you have to make it extremely clear what you want them to do, and eliminate all other distractions.</p><p>That’s where landing pages come in.</p><p>A landing page is a page designed specifically to get conversions after an ad is clicked&#8230;</p><p>&#8230;and it can make an enormous difference in how a campaign performs!</p><p>A landing page has one primary CTA (Call To Action), the page copy is written around the customer avatar and exactly the keywords you’re bidding on, and there are no links to other destinations.</p><p>In this case, this account was sending traffic directly to their website, but there was a ton of room for conversion rate optimization.</p><p>We want people to take action now and that is what a landing page will do.</p><p><span style="color: #4175fc;"><strong>How We Fixed It:</strong></span></p><p>To kick this campaign up a few more notches we needed a dedicated landing page.</p><p>Over the last few years, we have ran millions of dollars in ad spend and one thing is for sure &#8211; most people are BURNING money by not using high-converting landing pages.</p><p>So we started with one of our signature landing pages that encourage traffic to opt-in to view their current inventory and pricing.</p><p>We included a simple but to the point headline, a carefully crafted benefits section, and a clear Call-To-Action, all in a well designed, beautiful landing page.</p><p>The results?</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2990 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-4.png" alt="" width="628" height="209" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-4.png 628w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/85cpc-4-200x67.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></p><p>Cost: $1,820</p><p>Conversion Rate: 1.19%</p><p>Conversions: 32</p><p>Cost Per Conversion: $56.90</p><h2 id="conclusion"><span style="color: #4175fc;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2><p>By setting up proper tracking, optimizing the campaign with our specific process, and implementing a focused landing page, we were able to drop their CPL (Cost Per Lead) by over 85%!</p><p>If we generated the same amount of leads we did in July for the same price as April we would have spent $12,896, vs the $1,820 that we spent.</p><p>Cost: $2,020</p><p>Conversion Rate: 0.34%</p><p>Conversions: 5</p><p><strong>Cost Per Conversion: $403</strong>Cost: $1,690</p><p>Conversion Rate: 0.42%</p><p>Conversions: 7</p><p><strong>Cost Per Conversion: $241</strong>Cost: $1,820</p><p>Conversion Rate: 1.19%</p><p>Conversions: 32</p><p><strong>Cost Per Conversion: $56.90</strong></p><table width="515"><tbody><tr><td width="171"><p><strong>April 2019</strong></p><p>(Pre-PPC)</p></td><td width="171"><p><strong>June 2019</strong></p><p>(During PPC)</p></td><td width="172"><p><strong>July 2019</strong></p><p>(During PPC)</p></td></tr><tr><td width="171"><p>Work Done:</p><p>None (Pre-PPC)</p></td><td width="171"><p>Work Done:</p><p>Basic Restructure</p><p>Campaign Optimization</p></td><td width="172"><p>Work Done:</p><p>Advanced Optimization</p><p>Custom Landing Pages</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The great thing is we’re still not done.</p><p>Because we do daily management and ongoing optimization, we have a wealth of strategies to implement to take this campaign even farther as we get more data.</p><p>Additionally, as long as the client can handle the volume, we can work to scale it to the moon &#8211; all while maintaining a healthy CPL and lead quality.</p><p>Want us to help you with your PPC lead gen campaigns?

									<h2 id="background"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0673f1; text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></span></h2><p>A specialized e-commerce company reached out to us at the end of 2019 for assistance with their SEO. Their on¬¬line store offers super-absorbent hair towels. The same material is also available for sale as headbands, pillowcases, and shower caps.</p><p>This client launched its website in 2015 and had achieved some moderate traffic gains before reaching out. The problem was they couldn’t surpass 3,000 monthly visitors.</p><p>More web traffic means more eyes on inventory. We knew this company wanted to increase its online sales. But, first, we had to boost their SEO so more people were visiting their e-commerce store.</p><p>Our team started off by conducting a comprehensive SEO audit of their site. We do this for every client.</p><h2 id="audit"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0673f1; text-decoration: underline;">SEO Audit</span></span></h2><p>Before we could increase the number of visitors, we had to understand what was going on with their traffic, keywords, and backlinks.</p><p>The audit confirmed that the company’s traffic was flat. They would experience the occasional increase but it will drop shortly afterward. This seesaw trend had been happening for at least a year before they started working with us.</p><p>Web traffic hovered at about 2,000 visitors per month when they signed up with us in November 2019. Furthermore, they were only ranking for 1,650 keywords and their site had 170 referring domains (the number of external websites linking to them)</p><p>Our SEO team knew that in order to help this client we’d have to improve their search ranking by optimizing their keywords and gaining more backlinks. The first step was to determine our “easy win” keywords.</p><h2 id="research"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0673f1; text-decoration: underline;">Keyword Research</span></span></h2><p>What are “easy win” keywords?</p><p>These are keywords that a client is already ranking for in positions 4-30. With a few adjustments, these keywords can be incorporated into the client’s website and boost their ranking. It’s a quick and easy way to help them right out of the gate.</p><p>We found that this client was ranking for nearly 6,000 “easy win” keywords in the United States alone. They also sold products to many customers in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Once we identified all of these keywords, our next step was to find “easy win” keywords with a high search volume. For example, the keywords “hair bands” were in position seven yet had 14,000 searches per month.</p><p>Another example was “satin vs silk.” It was in position three and had a search volume of 4,400.</p><p>How do we get these keywords to start working for a client? After figuring out what they are, our writing team can incorporate these keywords into your web copy, blogs, or other ranked content.</p><h2 id="analysis"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0673f1; text-decoration: underline;">Analysis</span></span></h2><p>It’s around this point in the process when we start crafting our SEO strategy.</p><p>As part of our marketing research, we’ll also run a competitive gap analysis. The purpose of this is to find out what the client’s main competitors are doing and what we can incorporate into our strategy.</p><p>The competitive gap analysis involves keywords. Not everything a competitor is doing would be relevant to our client, but we want to make sure that we aren’t missing any opportunities.</p><p>We learned that our client had 43 online competitors. Some of these competitors were very similar to them, while the rest may have offered a few comparable products in their inventory.</p><p>For this analysis, we looked at their No. 1 competitor. While they both shared approximately 800 keywords, the competitor ranked for an additional 3,638 unique keywords.</p><p>These are keywords that our client wasn’t ranking for. As a result, our SEO team sifted through this list and found keywords that could work for them.</p><h2 id="strategy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0673f1; text-decoration: underline;">Strategy</span></span></h2><p>In the very beginning, this e-commerce client started using us for content syndication. A month later we convinced them to sign up for our managed SEO service.</p><p>Our expert team takes care of everything so business owners can focus on developing their operations. Clients can be as hands-on or hands-off as they wish, and they receive regular analytics reports.</p><p>We conferred with the client and decided that it was best to focus on content and gaining more backlinks.</p><p>Here are the products we used for their campaign:</p><p>● Guest Posts<br />● Blogs<br />● Link Building<br />● Content Syndication</p><p>We helped beef up the client’s content with a number of SEO-optimized blogs and earned them a few more backlinks with guest posts.</p><p>Our content syndication service was a great way for them to distribute their valuable content to high-authority news sites. Clients who take advantage of this product often receive media coverage that can be used as social proof on their websites.</p><h2 id="results"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0673f1; text-decoration: underline;">Results</span></span></h2><p>First, let’s take a look at the client’s traffic. We explained above how they never seemed to gain traction. After working with us for a year their traffic jumped to around 10,000 visitors per month.</p><p>Our team was able to increase their traffic so dramatically by optimizing their keywords and producing more quality content.</p><p>As you can see below, we increased their number of organic keywords from 1,650 to 14,254 today. That’s a 764% increase in keywords!</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2969 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/750-keyword-1.png" alt="" width="624" height="268" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/750-keyword-1.png 624w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/750-keyword-1-200x86.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p><p>Many of these new ranking keywords were some of the “easy wins” we incorporated into their strategy.

									<p>Developing your service-based company’s online authority is one of the best ways to attract new customers.</p><p>People searching for home repair companies, dental offices, or legal services want to know whether they’re hiring industry experts. Google’s search algorithm also boosts websites with high authority. Therefore, building authority should be one of your primary goals besides increased traffic and keywords.</p><p>This case study will show how a construction company working with us boosted its monthly traffic by over 1,000 visitors. And, more importantly, how they developed authority in the construction industry with a 400% increase in backlinks.</p><p>Keep reading below to find out how it was done.</p>								</div>

									<h2 id="background"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Background</span></h2><p>A construction company based in Michigan reached out to us wanting to increase their rankings and boost their online business. This family-owned and operated company has been providing specialized services to its service area since the early 1980s.</p><p> </p><p>We knew a robust SEO strategy including content and link building would increase monthly website traffic, but the company’s other goal was to optimize their local SEO with Google My Business. Local SEO is as important as general SEO for service-based companies like this client.</p><p>Once we started having conversations with them, we knew our managed SEO service was the right product.</p><h2 id="audit"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Auditing</span></h2><p>Before we can devise a winning strategy, we need to conduct an audit of a client’s website to find out its strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for growth.</p><p>First, we studied their monthly web traffic. Even though there had been some historic growth, the company’s number of visitors each month never surpassed 250. During the same period, its number of ranking keywords hovered around 100.</p><p>Earning backlinks is an effective and powerful way to boost a website’s traffic. A backlink is when an external website links to your website, which is typically done through content like blogs. The construction company had an average of 20 backlinks at any given time.</p><p>Finally, we determined that the value of its current traffic was a few hundred dollars each month. The client didn’t have pay-per-click or PPC ads, but if they did that’s how much it would cost to pay for the same amount of traffic.</p><h2 id="keyword"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Keyword Research</span></h2><p>Our next step in the process is to search for “easy win” keywords. These are keywords ranking in positions No. 4-30 that we can easily add to a client’s website to gain immediate results.</p><p>These keywords are typically low to medium difficulty and have a lower cost-per-click or CPC value. They won’t require as much of an effort as those ranking in positions No. 1-3.</p><p>We found 150+ “easy win” keywords. Not only do these keywords give us topic ideas for new blogs, but they can be added throughout web pages to boost rankings.</p><h2 id="analysis"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Analysis</span></h2><p>There is a lot that can be learned from studying the competition. After identifying the “easy win” keywords, we also search for unique keywords that our competitors are ranking for. These are keywords we can add to our SEO strategy to stay competitive.</p><p>Thirty-seven domains are in direct competition with the construction company. Some of these domains are more similar to the client than others. Many of their services overlap, yet we understand that every business is different.</p><p>With one competitor, for example, we found 445 keywords that our client wasn’t ranking for. Our team could comb through this list looking for relevant keywords that would help our SEO strategy.</p><h2 id="strategy"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Strategy</span></h2><p>Once we’ve completed an audit of the client’s site and a competitive gap analysis, we’re ready to design and implement an individualized SEO strategy. We enrolled the client in our managed SEO service so they had access to our full suite of products and a dedicated campaign manager to lead them through the process.</p><p>The first step was building up content on the website. Content is imperative to attracting new online visitors. They also help with developing a company’s authority in that field.</p><p>Our team researched trending topics and effective keywords for the client. We also managed internal and external links, and we ensured all content had a compelling call to action.</p><p>Through our link-building service, we reached out to existing blogs in the client’s niche. These backlinks improve a client’s domain authority and signal to Google that the website is a valuable resource. Part of the link-building strategy was also to ensure a diversity of backlink sources and anchor texts.</p><p>This client also specifically requested that we optimize their local SEO to rank on Google My Business and appear in the top map pack positions. Google My Business is a great way for local businesses to appear in searches. They enter business data, verify hours of operation, respond to local reviews, and add media.</p><p>Take a look at this sample map pack below:</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2903 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/400-percent-1.png" alt="" width="510" height="495" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/400-percent-1.png 510w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/400-percent-1-200x194.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p><p>Local ranking is determined by Google according to how well the business matches the search, distance from the user, and local prominence. Learn more about local SEO in this blog we wrote last year!</p><p>Overall, this client took advantage of several products to boost their SEO. Rather than paying for each product separately, they had access to use whatever they needed by enrolling in our fully managed SEO service. Now let’s take a look at whether our strategy worked.</p><h2 id="results"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Results</span></h2><p>After a few months with this new strategy, we were excited to report results to the client. Their traffic started to spike in the middle of 2020.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2905 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/400-percent-traffic.png" alt="" width="532" height="197" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/400-percent-traffic.png 532w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/400-percent-traffic-200x74.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" /></p><p>The client went from less than 250 monthly visitors to a record 1,500 this summer. One of the ways we achieved this was by ranking for more keywords across blogs and web copy. They also started ranking prominently in the Google map pack.</p><p>As you can see below, the client only ranked for approximately 330 keywords in the beginning. We increased their organic keywords to 750, which also included a significant increase in keywords at positions No. 4-10.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2902 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/40-percent-keywords.png" alt="" width="510" height="218" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/40-percent-keywords.png 510w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/40-percent-keywords-200x85.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p><p> </p><p>Link building was a large part of the SEO strategy as well. The construction company averaged around 20 backlinks when they first started working with us. Our new guest posts and link outreach resulted in the client maintaining close to 100 backlinks. That’s a 400% increase in backlinks!</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2904 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/400-percent-backlinks.png" alt="" width="508" height="192" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/400-percent-backlinks.png 508w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/400-percent-backlinks-200x76.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></p><p> </p><h2 id="conclusion"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Conclusion</span></h2><p>An SEO strategy can make or break your business. The right strategy can earn you thousands of new monthly visitors. Not doing anything can leave your business trapped in the status quo.</p><p>Our mission is to get to know our clients. We want to understand their business model and what goals they have for the future. That way we can partner with them to create an effective SEO strategy that will grow their business.</p><p>Many of our clients have been experiencing success thanks to our fully managed SEO service.

									<h2 id="background"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Background</span></h2><p>This is a car dealership with several locations based out of the UK. They focus on high-end luxury vehicles.</p><p>Most of the terms they want to target have search volume on the lower end, but are extremely lucrative.</p><p>Their goal was to first get their traffic back, as well as improve their rankings for a few key pages.</p><p>Here’s how we did it:</p><h2 id="audit"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Auditing</span></h2><p>The first thing we always do when we get a new site is to audit their SEO history.</p><p>This client was experiencing a significant drop in rankings due to the Google Core Algorithm Update in May.</p><p>This site’s rankings were affected due to having thin and duplicate pages with little-to-no content as well as a high bounce rate.</p><p>This type of problem is very common for auto dealers since most pages are typically just showing inventory pages. That also means there is a huge opportunity to win the traffic back!</p><p>They had actually started using our link building services ala-carte and saw a bit of traffic returning, then hopped into our managed SEO program a few months later.</p><h2 id="keyword"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Keyword Research</span></h2><p>One of the first things we take a look at is improving traffic to existing pages.</p><p>It’s common to find that many sites are close to ranking and getting traffic, but they just aren’t in the top positions yet.</p><p>For this we run our easy wins analysis and find keywords that the site is ranking for with the following metrics:</p><ul><li>Positions 4-30 with</li><li>KD equal to or less than 30</li><li>Minimum CPC .01</li></ul><p>That way we can find targetable, valuable keywords and pages that are on the verge of ranking and can easily be improved.</p><p>On this site, we found 460 potential targets, mostly on the bottom of page 1 through page 3 with CPC between $0.30 and $2.50.</p><p>These terms / URLs were primarily product pages leading to specific cars that are available. The keywords have low difficulty, and we can capitalize on these to quickly increase traffic.</p><h2 id="analysis"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Analysis</span></h2><p>The next thing we do is take a look at keywords that you’re competitors are targeting that you are not yet, and then focus on building out content for these opportunities.</p><p>The automotive industry is a bit different in terms of the content gap analysis.</p><p>When analyzing the competitive gap in this industry, you’ll often find keywords that are irrelevant and not worth targeting (i.e – specific car models, geo-targeted keywords, etc.)</p><p>Most of the top competing sites in this niche are thin on content, which allowed us to target the easy wins and create long blog content around them.</p><p>Each month we did a combination of high-quality link building and strategic content.</p><h2 id="strategy"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Strategy</span></h2><p>Once the keywords were identified, we optimized the website&#8217;s on-page elements such as meta tags, headings, and content to integrate these keywords naturally. We also created  high-quality, keyword-rich content around these keywords, focusing on providing valuable information to users.</p><p>Additionally, we leveraged off-page optimization techniques like link building and guest blogging to enhance your website&#8217;s authority and credibility. This helped search engines recognize the main website as a valuable resource for the targeted keywords.</p><p>The aim was to quickly improve website visibility, increase organic traffic over time, and establish a solid foundation for long-term SEO success.</p><h2 id="results"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Results</span></h2><p>After targeting this site’s easy win key terms, we’ve bumped many of them to page 1. The top 10 keywords are currently all ranking on page 1:</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2872 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/car-dealer-keywords.png" alt="" width="331" height="655" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/car-dealer-keywords.png 331w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/car-dealer-keywords-200x396.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /></p><p>Here’s an example of their #1 exact match key term that experienced serious movement after the 3 month result period of using our managed SEO program.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2871 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/car-dealer-keyword-rank-graph.png" alt="" width="628" height="263" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/car-dealer-keyword-rank-graph.png 628w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/car-dealer-keyword-rank-graph-200x84.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></p><h2 id="conclusion"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Conclusion</span></h2><p>When this client switched over to our managed SEO service, their organic traffic and traffic value started to consistently increase every month.</p><p>We focused on building out quality content on the site and a combination of our link building techniques.</p><p>As you can see in the image below, the site&#8217;s backlinks, organic keywords, organic traffic, and traffic value are consistently improving as well.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2873 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/car-dealer-metrics.png" alt="" width="628" height="111" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/car-dealer-metrics.png 628w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/car-dealer-metrics-200x35.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></p><p>After a few consistent months of hard work, we’ve recovered this site’s organic traffic, bumped many of their keywords up to page 1, and doubled their organic traffic value!</p><p>If you’d like some help with your site (even if you’ve had a penalty or dropped in traffic), you might be interested in our managed SEO program.</p><div> </div>								</div>

									<p>Do colleges and training programs need to worry about SEO as much as e-commerce or repair service companies? The answer is yes.</p><p>You may not think so because they’re established organizations with hundreds of students and thousands of other prospects looking to apply each year. But, the truth is schools need to worry about SEO just as much as other businesses.</p><p>In this case study, you’ll learn how we helped a beauty salon institute in Florida to increase its organic traffic by nearly 5X and keyword totals by nearly 7.5X in 15 months!</p><p>It was all done by optimizing the institute’s website and setting them up to be an authority in the beauty industry.</p><p>Keep scrolling below to find out exactly how we did it.</p>								</div>

				<div class="elementor-widget-container">
									<h2 id="background"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Background</span></h2><p>A premier salon institute in Florida contacted us in February 2020 for assistance with growing their keywords, web content, and organic traffic. They operate a large physical facility with a student salon clinic area featuring dozens of stations for hairstyling, manicures, pedicures, and more.</p><p>As an accredited college, the institute’s goal is to help students obtain gainful employment in the beauty industry by providing high-quality education in cosmetology.</p><p>The first thing we noticed was that their website didn’t have a blog, which was a missed opportunity for boosting SEO and establishing themselves as an authority. We also noticed they weren’t ranking for many keywords or getting as much traffic as they wanted.</p><h2 id="audit"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Auditing</span></h2><p>Once we spoke with the client about their concerns and goals, the next step was to initiate our SEO audit. This is something we do with all new clients: a comprehensive review of traffic, keywords, positions, traffic value, and more.</p><p>We discovered that their website was launched in June 2017 and until they reached out to us in February 2020 they couldn’t seem to break through a ceiling of 250 organic monthly visitors.</p><p>The institute’s keywords had increased gradually over the first year of using their new website but those numbers remained below 500 until they started working with us.</p><p>And, finally, we learned they were having some success with obtaining backlinks from websites or articles, but we knew many more would be needed to give them the boost they were looking for.</p><h2 id="keyword"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Keyword Research</span></h2><p>Anyone who has worked in SEO before understands it could take three months or more to see any significant results. The problem is new clients like to see the needle move when they start working with us.</p><p>For this reason, our second step after the SEO audit is to find “easy win” keywords. These are keywords that a client’s website is already ranking for in positions 4-30. All we have to do is make a few adjustments to their web copy and start capitalizing on the gains.</p><p>We found that the institute had 324 “easy win” keywords. Of these keywords, we looked for ones that had a high search volume and low keyword difficulty level. “Hair levels” for example had a search volume of 3,800 but a difficulty of 6 out of 100.</p><h2 id="analysis"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Analysis</span></h2><p>In marketing and advertising, you can learn a lot from what your competition is doing.</p><p>Our research indicated that this institute’s top competitors included other technical colleges and cosmetology programs throughout the United States. One of their Top 10 competitors, for example, ranked for 3,200 keywords that our client had not been ranking for.</p><p>Our campaign managers were able to search through these keywords and find new ones that could be added to our client’s SEO strategy. Not every keyword would work for them, but it was a good place to start generating new ideas.</p><p>Overall, this client was competing against 44 unique domains, a few of which were vying for similar students in Florida.</p><h2 id="strategy"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Strategy</span></h2><p>Next came the exciting part. After all of our audits and research, we were able to craft an SEO strategy and implement it for this client. This strategy would need to address their lack of keywords and low website traffic.</p><p>In order to deliver the results our client wanted, we needed a long-term strategy with access to multiple products. We didn’t know whether other SEO products would be needed to accomplish our objectives.</p><p>The best way to do this was to register the client for our comprehensive managed SEO service. This provided our campaign managers with the flexibility to get the job done right and take day-to-day management out of the client’s hands. They could use this new free time to focus on their mission.</p><p>One of the first things we noticed during our consultation with this client was how they had no blog.</p><p>We helped the institute to launch its blog and started writing SEO-optimized content. Our goal was to establish them as an authority in the beauty industry and use high-ranking keywords in the copy.</p><p>The client was uncertain about how our services were going to work for their website and it took them some time to develop a schedule for uploading new blog content, but once the materials were uploaded to their site, web traffic started to soar.</p><h2 id="results"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Results</span></h2><p>The campaign we started in February 2020 lasted for a total of 15 months. There was a lag from when the client started uploading the new content we provided, but you can see the spike in organic traffic in the third month.</p><p>It is important to note that most SEO campaigns can take months to take any effect, even if new content was uploaded immediately.</p><p>The client’s site was getting a little over 100 visits when they started the campaign. Today, they’re getting over 500 monthly visitors.</p><p>The same went for their ranking keywords. When the campaign started they ranked for about 200 keywords, which had been pretty steady for years. Below you can see how their keywords increased to over 1,500 in April 2021.</p><p>In the end, we increased their organic traffic by nearly 5X and keyword totals by nearly 7.5X.</p><p>Our campaign managers used a variety of SEO products to benefit the client: blogs, guest posts, video, syndication, and link building.</p><p>How do we know that our content worked? A simple search of the institute’s site indicated that the top three most popular web pages were blogs written by us. One blog on skincare even ranks in the No. 1 position for its keyword.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Conclusion</span></h2><p>If there’s one thing we want you to take away from this case study, it’s that content is still king. Well-written blogs or web copy optimized for SEO can drive up your rankings and bring you more organic traffic.</p><p>This salon institute learned how valuable a new blog was to connect with prospective students. Everyone uses Google to research schools or training programs these days so it was imperative the client appeared in searches and stuck out from the crowd.</p><p>Would you like to learn more about how blogs or keyword strategies can help grow your business?</p><p>Reach out to us now and let’s chat about your business and goals for the future.</p><div> </div>								</div>

									<p>In this case study, you’ll learn how in only six months we increased traffic to a law firm’s website by 800% and how their traffic is now valued at $11,714 per month.</p><p>Law firms depend on web traffic for leads but the number of active lawyers has increased 15% over the last decade. These days, to rank on Google and have a law firm’s website stand out from the crowd, the SEO needs to be on point.</p><p>It didn’t require a huge investment and it wasn’t as hard as you might think.</p><p>Ready to learn how we did it? Let’s get into it!</p>								</div>

									<h2 id="background"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Background</span></h2><p>This Texas law firm reached out to us at the end of 2019 to help optimize its website. The site first launched in June 2015 and hadn’t seen much traffic growth in four years.</p><p>When they officially started using our managed SEO service in October 2019, the firm’s organic traffic was just over 500 visitors a month.</p><p>They wanted to increase their online rankings to drive more qualified traffic to their website, ultimately getting them more leads and clients.</p><h2 id="audit"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Auditing</span></h2><p>Our first step with any client is to complete a full SEO audit of their website. We need to know what we’re working with before strategizing and planning any campaigns.</p><p>Right away we knew that the legal industry was a very competitive space. Through our audit we found out that to rank locally in their city for the phrase “law firm,” it was going to take an estimated 310 backlinks to get inside the top 10 spots.</p><p>The firm had some luck with landing backlinks on their own but it was clear there was a lot more work to be done. And luckily, link building is our specialty.</p><h2 id="keyword"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Keyword Research</span></h2><p>We work smarter for our clients by identifying “easy wins” keywords.</p><p>These are keywords the website is already ranking for in positions 4-30. Since these keywords are already ranking near the top, we can focus on them for some quick traffic jumps!</p><p>Once we identify these keywords we can use them strategically to improve a client’s overall ranking.</p><p>We found a total of 667 “easy win” keywords. Some of them had incredibly high search volumes and wouldn’t take much to rank in the Top 10.</p><p>Our client wasn’t buying ads for this campaign but we identified some valuable keywords during our research. The keyword “domestic violence charge in texas” had a cost-per-click or CPC of $90, telling us that if we could rank for the term, it would be very valuable.</p><p>While that dollar amount might sound astronomical, you have to remember that the legal industry is a highly competitive space. When law firms are making thousands of dollars from clients, $90 (and sometimes much higher) is an investment they can easily make a return on.</p><h2 id="analysis"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Analysis</span></h2><p>Understanding what your competitors are doing provides valuable insights. A competitive gap analysis will help show you areas that your competitors are doing better than you in.</p><p>We found there were 2,852 unique keywords not being used by our client. Most of these were keywords having to do with marijuana laws, which was one of their legal specialties. We built content on their website based on the keywords we found to start driving targeted traffic.</p><p>What excited us even more about discovering these keywords was how they could help us generate ideas for blog posts for the client’s website.</p><h2 id="strategy"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Strategy</span></h2><p>The law firm took advantage of our link-building program where they would receive contextual links from authority sites. <br />We paired that with other high-level links from our guest post product. High-quality guest posts are one of the most effective ways to boost your site up the SERPs.</p><p>Our guest posting product fits their campaign so well because it’s fully customizable. Clients can choose the blog length (500-2,000 words) and whether they want to focus on getting published based on domain authority or the publisher’s website traffic.</p><p>We assured them results won’t happen overnight, explaining that SEO results often take weeks or months to take effect. But once they did, they were blown away.</p><h2 id="results"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Results</span></h2><p>What we observed in this case study was textbook SEO.</p><p>The client’s organic traffic was in the 500s when we kicked off their campaign in October 2019. Now (in May 2020) it’s over 7,700 visitors per month and continues trending upwards.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2830 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Law-firm-organic-traffic-and-keywords.png" alt="" width="624" height="477" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Law-firm-organic-traffic-and-keywords.png 624w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Law-firm-organic-traffic-and-keywords-200x153.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p><p>That’s an organic traffic increase of over 800%!</p><p>By using a combination of our foundational link building and guest posts, we were able to push extremely valuable keywords into the top 10.</p><p>We got some of their keywords onto page 1 of Google, contributing to the massive traffic spike.</p><p>The client’s referring domains increased by more than 1,000%!</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2831 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/law-firm-referring.png" alt="" width="624" height="249" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/law-firm-referring.png 624w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/law-firm-referring-200x80.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p><p>This campaign was solely for organic traffic (no paid advertising). But it’s worth noting that the client’s traffic value jumped from approximately $550 when we started working together to $11,714 per month.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2832 size-full" src="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/law-firm-traffic-value.png" alt="" width="624" height="244" srcset="https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/law-firm-traffic-value.png 624w, https://davisdigitalconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/law-firm-traffic-value-200x78.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p><p>That means it would cost them almost $12K in paid advertising a month to get the same amount of traffic they are getting now with the organic search! Take a look at the value growth below.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><span style="color: #0673f1;">Conclusion</span></h2><div><p>This law firm came to us for help with boosting their rankings and traffic. We knew they’d be a great fit for our managed SEO program.</p><p>Rather than purchasing our other products one-by-one, they were able to take advantage of an autopilot SEO campaign, crafted and managed by one of our SEO experts.</p><p>Link building is the key to search rankings and we also knew that powerful guest posts would help move the needle. In the end, we boosted their organic traffic by over 800% and put them at the top of the SERPs to help them get more leads and clients.</p><p>Ready to learn more or get started?
